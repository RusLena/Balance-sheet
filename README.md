# Balance Sheet FreeCodeCamp Project

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum and focuses on creating a simple **balance sheet** using HTML and CSS. The goal is to design a webpage that displays a balance sheet, which includes two main sections: **Assets** and **Liabilities**.

## Project Overview

In this project, we create a basic balance sheet layout with HTML and CSS. It includes two columns: one for assets and another for liabilities. The layout is styled to provide clear separation and visual structure, similar to a financial statement.
